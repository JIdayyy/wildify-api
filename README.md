- This is a simple API to manage songs.

- Objects are sent to MINIO.

I'll write the documentation later. But for now, you can use the following endpoints:

(URL is http://yourdomainorlocalhost/api/v1/)

- GET /songs : return a list of songs.
- GET /songs/:id : return a song.
- POST /songs : create a song.
- PUT /songs/:id : update a song.
- DELETE /songs/:id : delete a song.

- GET /artists : return a list of artists.
- GET /artists/:id : return an artist.
- POST /artists : create an artist.
- PUT /artists/:id : update an artist.
- DELETE /artists/:id : delete an artist.

- GET /albums : return a list of albums.
- GET /albums/:id : return an album.
- POST /albums : create an album.
- PUT /albums/:id : update an album.

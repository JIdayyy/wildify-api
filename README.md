- This is a simple API to manage songs.

- Objects are sent to MINIO.

I'll write the documentation later. But for now, you can use the following endpoints:

(URL is http://yourdomainorlocalhost/api/v1/)

- GET /songs : returns a list of songs.
- GET /songs/:id : returns a song.
- POST /songs : creates a song.
- PUT /songs/:id : updates a song.
- DELETE /songs/:id : deletes a song.
